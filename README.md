# DataLens

DataLens is a human-in-the-loop data quality assistant for structured procurement data.
It helps data stewards and procurement analysts find, understand, review, and prioritize quality issues in vendor records and transaction records.
It is explicitly a data quality project, not a fraud detection system.

## Current delivery stage

The current delivery stage establishes the reproducible project foundation.
Milestones remain in progress until their acceptance criteria are verified and their pull requests are merged, or completion is explicitly confirmed.

## Requirements

- Git 2.50 or later
- uv 0.11 or later
- Python 3.11

uv installs and manages the project environment from the checked-in lock file.

## Setup

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/ibikigosu/DataLens.git
Set-Location DataLens
uv sync --all-groups
```

## Verify the repository

Run the complete local verification:

```powershell
uv run python scripts/verify.py
```

The individual checks are:

```powershell
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run ruff check .
uv run pytest --cov=datalens --cov-report=term-missing
```

## Repository layout

```text
artifacts/        Generated analysis and baseline outputs
config/           Versioned data acquisition and evaluation settings
data/             Local raw and processed data plus versioned provenance manifests
notebooks/        Reproducible exploratory analysis
scripts/          Mentor-facing verification helpers
src/datalens/     Reusable Python package code
tests/            Automated tests
```

Downloaded data and generated artifacts are intentionally excluded from Git.
Small metadata manifests remain versioned so a mentor can see exactly how a local dataset was produced.

## Important boundaries

- FastAPI will own application and scoring behavior in later milestones.
- Streamlit will remain a thin API client.
- Naturally unusual USAspending records are not labeled as defects without evidence.
- Controlled defects are retained separately from reviewer feedback.
- No source dataset is automatically corrected or overwritten.
